knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```

# 1. Pull, Push and Commits

Git is a powerful tool, at the same time this it allows to control almost all aspects of versioning in our project, it can be very scary. However, as a starting point we need to understand basically three actions: pull, commit and push. The illustration bellow gives a good overview about how those three actions work.

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE,out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "git_pull_comm_push.png"))
```

Let's go to the R scripts to use these commands

# 2. The importance of commits 

What is a commit?

A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).


```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE,out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "git_commit_illustration.png"))
```


## Exploring commits

A litlle about terminology:

- **Origin**: The default upstream repository

- **Master** (sometimes **Main**): the main branch of your repo

- **diff**: differences between two commits in a file

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "commit-model.png"))
```

## Revisiting the past using commits

We can navigate through the past commits by using RStudio or GitHub.

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "history-RStudio.png"))
```


# 3. Organizing local repo

We have, at least 3 different types of files:

- R scripts and functions
- data 
- output
- [README](https://github.com/drsimonj/R-template-project)

So it is reasonable to organize our repository with the following template:

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "directory_org.png"))
```
Some tools can help you to get an automated scaffold directory for your project, for example, see this one by [Carl Boettiger](https://github.com/cboettig/template), and this by [Francisco Rodriguez-Sanchez](https://github.com/Pakillo/template). In essence, you will notice that the structure of these directories resembles the structure of an R package.



# 4. Now let'ts organize our data and scripts

# Naming files

A good rule is: 

**Human + Machine redable**

Example:

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "naming-files-data.png"))
```

# Naming scripts

Particularly, I use the following rule

**number_upper-case-letter_What-the-script-does.R**

- number: used to indicate the sequence to run the scripts

- uper case letter: what the script does (proccess, clean, analysis, function)

- What the script does: a brief description of what the script does
